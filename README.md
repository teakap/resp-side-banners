# Discourse Theme Switcher

After a lot of feedback I encapsulated the Theme Switcher from my [Alien Night](https://meta.discourse.org/t/alien-night-theme-a-free-dark-theme-for-discourse/54175) Theme to this Theme Switcher Theme Component.

# Installation

https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-do-i-install-a-theme-or-theme-component/63682

# Note

At the moment it will switch your theme into a dark mode (see [Alien Night Preview](https://theme-creator.discourse.org/theme/B-iggy/alien-night-theme)).
Later on I can maybe implement a setting page, where you can define just a global class to switch your theme into it.
